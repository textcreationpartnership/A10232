            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25053:7"/>
as may bee read from the beginning of it, unto the 17 verſ. In the verſes following he inſiſtes upon the Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their careleſnes in not preparing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to come unto it. This corruption of theirs he</p>

And thus was CHRIST led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſſe to be tempted of the Divell, that is, to bee tryed by thoſe meanes hee then uſed if happily hee might bee perſwaded to ſinne, and doe that, that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in a good ſenſe it is a lawfull try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <note place="margin">What it is to examine.</note> an uſing of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to a good purpoſe.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25053:11"/>
who in the meane time doe utterly neglect themſelves; they can ſoone eſpy the leaſt mote that is in their brothers eye, but will not ſee the beame that is in their own: ſeldome doe wee looke after the corruption of our owne harts, like her in the Poet, who never went from home, but ſhe put on her eyes, that ſhee might ſee the faults of others; but when ſhee came home ſhee put them off, that ſhee might not ſee her owne.

the Will of the Lord that every man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not his neighbour; that office he reſerves to himſelfe, or his publique Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Now good reaſon is there why a man muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, They will ſearch <hi>Conſtantly,</hi> they will not give over till they have found, ſo muſt wee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſearching, for the heart is deceitfull.</p>

                  <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note>. The way to prevent theſe is to judge our ſelves, by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ourſelves, for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, examine your ſelves, prove your ſelves.

               <p>Wee may reade how that a ſtranger to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Iſraell might not eate of the holy things, in the time of the Law <note n="r" place="margin">Lev. 22. 10.</note>: and ſurely a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the life of grace, ought not to taſte of the holy things in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the time of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The Lord was ſtrict concerning them who were to appeare before him, at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in ſo much that if the beaſt did but touch the Mountaine, hee muſt be ſtoned to death <note n="ſ" place="margin">Exod. 19. 13.</note>.

If the Lord was thus ſtrict concerning thoſe, O what ſhall become of thoſe, who dare approach into Chriſts preſence, and come to his Table with beaſtly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! ſhall not the y be lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judgment? if the Chamber was trimmed, wherein the Paſſe-over was celebrated, and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtituted <note n="t" place="margin">Mark. 14 15.</note>, how ſhould the Chambers of our Soules bee cleanſed from prophaneſſe, and adorned with grace?

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge to bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, you heard, was concerning God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25053:25"/>
Firſt, That God is, that there is a God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this God is moſt glorious in his nature; Incorporeall, Eternall, Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Omnipotent, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, All-ſufficient, Immortall, Holy, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Now this knowledge is neceſſary, if wee did but conſider the Fruits of it. For whoſoever thus knows God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hee will alwayes adore, and feare this great, and glorious Majeſty <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 11. 33. 36.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hee will ſet his hart and affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he will <hi>love him with all his ſoule, and all his might</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 30 6.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee will ſerve
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25053:25"/>
him with all poſsible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, put on hee will all the beauties of the beſt holineſſe he can get, when hee comes into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 4. 24</note>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hee will hate ſinne, and ſtrive all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible imitation of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note n="d" place="margin">1 Peter. 1 15, 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, It will make him alwayes remember him <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Hee will feare no evill, nor enemy; for hee knowes that GOD knowes them, and what it is they intend: it is the Lord that ſaid, <hi>bee ſtrong and of a good courage, bee not afrayd: for the Lord thy God is with thee whereſoever thou goeſt,</hi> ſaith the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient God to <hi>Ioſhua</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:25053:26"/>
Now the third thing to bee examined concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God is, whether we know that hee is three in perſons. Certaine it is that he is diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three perſons, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But many are ignorant <note place="margin">God is three in Perſons.</note> of this, therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes receivers to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether they know that there is more than one Perſon, God ſaid <hi>let us make man</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether they know that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are three in number, <hi>There are three that beare record in heaven, and theſe three are one</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">John 5. 7</note>.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever knowes this, whenſoever hee comes to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25053:26"/>
worſhip God, hee will make conſcience of it, that he rob not any of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their glory.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing to bee examined concerning God <note place="margin">God is one in eſſence.</note> is, whether wee know that he is one in eſſence. Though there bee but one God, yet ſuch is the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of man as that hee affects the honor that is due unto God, and ſo makes more Gods: ſuch was that ambition of <hi>Herod</hi> when hee was delighted with that cry of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>the voyce of God, and not of man</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Acts. 12. 22.</note>. Thus it is with man naturally that hee ſeeketh himſelfe, and his own honor, and ſo forgetteth to <hi>give honor, to whom honor is due</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Joſh. 7. 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:25053:27"/>
Whoſoever hath this knowledge, he will.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Love the Lord alone, and love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all; and this hee will ſhew by ſerving him onely, for hee <hi>is Lord only, and he muſt be loved with all our hart, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all our ſoule, and all our might</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 6. 4. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that ever hee rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any other, then upon him <note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 32 37, 38, 39.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee will uſe but one Mediatour to him, for <hi>there is one God, and one Mediatour, between God and man, which is the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the examination of our knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25053:27"/>
of God: now every receiver muſt examine his knowledge concerning the Workes of God. For as hee is marveilouſly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his nature, ſo is hee alſo great in his Workes.</p>
            <p>Now the knowledge is.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning Gods Creation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>For the Creation, the knowledge to be examined is ſixe-fould.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning the Worlds beginning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Concerning the Worlds Maker.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Concerning the matter whereof all was made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:25053:28"/>
Fourthly, All made by his Word onely.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, All were made good.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, All were made freely, and not of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our knowledge <note place="margin">The World had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</note> to be examined is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the beginning of the World. Sure it is,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>That the World had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</head>
               <p>There was a time when the World was not; it was not etereall <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note>, <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth.</hi> If it had a beginning, then it could not be from eternity: it is the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that <hi>hee choſe us in him,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:25053:28"/>
                  <hi>before the foundation of the World.</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus knowledge will bring us to another and that is, that the World ſhall have an end. <hi>The Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the earth and the Workes that are therein ſhall be burnt up, all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Pet. 2 3. 10, 11.</note>. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the former, for <hi>quicquid finem habet, id e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam aliquo tempore initium habuiſse conſtat,</hi> whatſoever hath an end, that alſo ſometime had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to bee examined is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee know that the VVorld and all things
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25053:29"/>
therein was made by <note place="margin">God made the World.</note> God.</p>
               <p>God made the World <note n="q" place="margin">1 Gen. 1.</note>. <hi>In the beginning God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Heavens and the Earth.</hi> God made the World, and all things that are therein <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 17. 24</note>. <hi>By him were all things created, which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Col. 1. 16</note>.</p>
               <p>Now this brings us to to the knowledge of many things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That all things <note place="margin">All things had one principle.</note> had one principle, one cauſe, the Lord. To have two eternall poſitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, two principles, a good and a bad; the good to make light, the bad darkneſſe; the good health, the bad ſickneſſe, this is abſured. The Scripture tels
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25053:29"/>
us, it is GOD that made the World and all things therein: and this muſt bee known that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though GOD made the World, yet God made not the evill that are in the World; he that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Tree, planteth not a Worme in the Tree, but there it breedeth.</p>
               <p>God created the World, there was no death, no ſickneſſe; theſe came by the ſinnes of men, and Angels. He that made man, <note place="margin">Ab Angelo uſque ad vermicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum S. Aug.</note> 
                  <hi>made him after his owne Image, but man hath ſought out many inventions</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Eccl. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note>. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God made all things that hath poſitive beings; ſinne hath not, beeing the abſence of that good, that ſhould be in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:25053:30"/>
Secondly, That God <note place="margin">God onely can Create.</note> onely can create. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of any Creature, it is a worke of an infinite power, to bring light out of darkeneſſe, man out of the duſt: and who can do this, but the Lord?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This will <note place="margin">Creation muſt bee conſidered.</note> cauſe us to ſpend ſome time in conſideration of the Creatures, who have ſuch a Maker: for <hi>the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall power, and inviſible things of God, are ſeene by the Creation of the World</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note>.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This will ſtirre us up to praiſe the Lord: as <hi>David, I will praiſe the Lord, for I am wonderfully, and fearefully made</hi> 
                  <note n="w" place="margin">Pſal. 139 14.</note>.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:25053:30"/>
               <head>The next thing to be known is, that all were made of nothing.</head>
               <p>They were not made of things, which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 11. 3. <hi>All things were made of nothing.</hi>
                  </note> know wee muſt that God made them of nothing, no matter prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent; creation hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for its matter, in this it differs from naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which cannot bring a thing out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Now this will teach us,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To admire the power, and goodneſſe of God, who is able to draw ſuch an excellent frame out of nothing.</p>

               <p>And thus it holds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Bread is the principall ſupporter of mans life; now as Bread is of naturall life, ſo the Lord Jeſus is of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: bread in regard of the ſtrength of it, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Staffe of Bread</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Bread takes away corporall hunger, and as bread takes away corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hunger, ſo the Lord Jeſus takes away ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Bread profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none but ſuch as are hungry, it doth no good unto them that are filled, and glutted; the Lord Jeſus profiteth none, but thoſe who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Wine cheereth up the heart of man</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſ. 104. 15</note>; the promiſes of the Lord Jeſus cheere up the ſoule, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wine mundi fies, &amp; cleanſes the wounds of the body; the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Wine takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fearefulneſſe, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth boldneſſe; the blood of the Lord Jeſus by faith aſſures us of Gods favour, eaſes us of the Curſe of the Law, makes us conſtant in the confeſsion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This the Analogie and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:25053:74"/>
proportion is, ſo that Wine <note place="margin">The Cup no to be denied</note> cannot without great wrong be denied unto the people: the Papiſts doe it, who like the falſe Mother, would have the child divided; the Lord is the true Mother, and cannot indure it: what man will indure in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary refreſhing to have the Cup taken from him? the blood of Chriſt is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>for we were not redeemed with corruptible things, but the blood of the Son of God, as a Lamb unſpotted and undefiled.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord ſaith <note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18.</note>. <hi>drink yee all of this</hi>

with Chriſt and his Church as in other matters, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Scripture not the perfect rule of faith, but patch it up with their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they make Chriſt but halfe a Saviour: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould deale with their Prieſts in their offerings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condingly, it would either coole their devotion, or work a reformation.</p>

               <p>Firſt, The taking of Bread and Wine, with the outward hands of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſignifies the taking of Chriſt with the inward hand of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The eating of the Bread, and the drinking of the Wine, ſignifies a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar applying of Chriſt unto our ſoules, that even as Bread and Wine being digeſted in the ſtomacks of our bodies is conjoyned to the body, and made a part and member of the body: ſo Chriſt received and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

generall and ſpeciall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that every Receiver muſt examine himſelfe of. Now come wee to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing to be examined, and that is faith; for every man receiveth ſo much as he beleeveth he receiveth.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Therefore every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought, by examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to dig into their hearts to find it, and by the Word, as by fire, to trie whether it bee a ſaving faith, or no. This is that, that puts life into us; I, the life of God, for till then our cogitation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:25053:78"/>

               <p>It concernes all men to know that untill they bee beleevers, they belong not to God: for as the Eagle refuſeth her birds till they can mount, and ſoare to the Sunne; and as the Raven acknowledgeth not her young ones, till they be black; ſo God rejecteth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and receiveth none till they beleeve: none are the ſonnes of God but the faithfull, the reſt are baſtards.

               <p>Thirdly, A ſaving Faith is a lively Faith, it makes thoſe that have it live the life of grace <note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 3. 11.</note>. Saint <hi>James</hi> tells us of a dead Faith <note n="u" place="margin">James 2. 20, 26.</note>.</p>

though they had it not at one time; yet they might have it at another, but this cannot be.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle tells us <hi>that all men have not Faith</hi> 
                  <note n="w" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 2.</note>. And no wonder, for all men have not that, that is inferiour to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon then a ſaving Faith, an hiſtoricall Faith, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Goſpell <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23.</note>,</p>

But the meaning is, that when Chriſt ſhall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſhall finde few in the earth, that have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith in compariſon of them, that have it not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All men have not a ſaving Faith, becauſe all men ſhall not be ſaved, <hi>for as many as are ſaved are ſaved by Faith</hi>

confeſſeth of himſelfe, that being inclined to the hereſie of the Manichees, he heard a voyce, ſaying <hi>Tolle &amp; lege,</hi> take up and reade; meaning the Booke of God; which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently did, and ſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was converted: for ſurely the reading of the Word is a meanes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, to the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faith, and raiſing up the kingdom of God in the hearts of men; ſo that to ſay that bare reading, is bare feeding, and a thing unable to worke faith in us, is to avouch a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>

uſuall meanes: this is that which the Scripture layeth downe: <hi>how ſhall they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? how ſhall they heare without a preacher</hi>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:25053:91"/>
preaching, then reacheth the ſavor of ſuch heavenly ſweet to many moe, in a fuller meaſure, by reaſon of the bleſsing God giveth unto it.

The Apoſtle ſaith that his preaching was in demonſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:25053:92"/>
that their faith might <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2 4. 5</note> be in the power of God, and the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is tearmed <hi>a miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit</hi>

our hearts as hee did the heart of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Vpon diligent hearing, the Lord inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the minde to conceive and underſtand the way of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Vpon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, the great God perſwades us to beleeve <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 15. 7 1 Cor. 3. 4</note>.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, After this God inclines the heart to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the goodnes of the things promiſed (which is ſalvation) and to hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>God is the worker, men are inſtruments; <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, but God that gives the increaſe. <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Philippi,</hi> but God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia, Peter</hi> preached to <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and others, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt brought downe the Unction, and made them Chriſtians.</p>

Now this Knowledge, that God is the Author of Repentance will teach us many things.</p>
               <p>1. That no man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <note place="margin">No man can repent when hee will.</note> when hee will, this flower groweth not in our Gardens; if that the Lord by his Spirit draw us not, we can never run after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Why have we ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commandements to repent, if it be not in our power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp. Deus jubet quae non poſsumus, ut noverimus quid ab eo petere debeamus,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> God commands what we cannot doe, that we may know what to ask of him. I, this God doth to let us ſee, not what by Nature wee can doe, but what wee in Duty
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:25053:116"/>
ſhould doe, and that by his aſsiſtance we may bee ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to performe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. God gave Jezabel ſpace to repent of her fornication:</hi> hence the Papiſts gather that man hath free will to do that that is good before God; for, ſay they, God gave ſpace of time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, therfore ſhe had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to repent, the giving of that power was in vain elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> It doth not follow becauſe God gave time to repent, therefore ſhee had power to repent: which we may ſee, if wee doe but conſider the ends for which God gives men ſpace, and time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo ſo to doe. The ends be two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:25053:117"/>
Firſt, That in that time of Repentance, which hee allotteth unto men, he may give his children grace, whereby they may obey his Commandements, and repent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hee giveth Commandement and time that men may ſee what they ſhovld doe, not what they can doe, and that the wicked may be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe at the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo aſhamed of <note place="margin">Biſhop Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> themſelves. Man cannot doe it of himſelfe, it is a worke full of miracles, it makes the dead to riſe, the blinde to ſee, the dumbe to ſpeake, and who can worke theſe but the Lord? as one ſheepe cannot heale another, but their helpe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:25053:117"/>
commeth from the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard: ſo the true health of our ſoules commeth from the great Sepheard of Iſraell; he that tamed the Lyons, and reſtrained the fire from burning, he it is that muſt tame our wild af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and moderate the fire of our deſires.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">Aſcribe unto God the glory of converſion.</note> of Repentance, will teach us unto whom to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all the glory of our converſion, even to the Lord, for he it is that hath done it, of our ſelves wee can doe nothing that is good, we muſt bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Object. Doth not God promiſe, at what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth of his ſinne,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:25053:118"/>
I will put all his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse out of my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> True, the Lord moſt comfortably (bleſſed be his name for it) ſaith, at what time a ſinner repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of his ſinne, hee will pardon; but hee doth not ſay that a ſinner may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when hee will, God hath promiſed to all repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants pardon, but not to all delinquents repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>3. This Knowledge in the third place will teach <note place="margin">The meanes of grace is not to bee neglected.</note> us to bee carefull that wee neglect not the preſent meanes of grace offered unto us, as though wee had God at command, and could repent when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wee pleaſe.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:25053:118"/>
beloved, let none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, deceive not your owne ſoules, it is the meere Gift of God, wee cannot make one haire of our head white or black, and doe wee thinke wee can change our corrupt hearts?</p>
               <p>Looke but into the Scriptures and ſee how many when they would have repented, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, I, though they ſought it with teares; and what comfort is this to thee who haſt not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neyther doſt thou know, whether that God will give thee grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> The theife repented at the laſt, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:25053:119"/>
                  <hi>was received to mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> True, what then? if that I may but have time when I am dying, to ſay Lord have mercy upon me, I ſhall be ſaved; but what if thou ſhalt not have ſo much time? thou art not ſure of it, death hath taken many a one away ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that they have not ſpoke one word: againe, what if thou haſt ſo much time? many ſhall ſay in that day, Lord, Lord, and he ſhall ſay unto them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from mee, I know you not <note n="e" place="margin">Mat 7. 22</note>. The Thiefe was ſaved, for he repented, his fellow had no grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp; was damned. O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leaſt truſting too late Repentance at thy laſt end on earth, thou bee not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:25053:119"/>
to repent too late with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end in hell.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this Knowledge will cauſe us to ſerve God <note place="margin">God muſt be ſerved freely.</note> freely, for if God hath wrought in any of us, if our wills be freed by grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe, then will we ſerve God freely, and cheerefully, wee will then obey the Lord willingly. The godly man knowes that the fruit that is cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelled downe, is ill taſted, and little worth: ſo is that obedience men muſt bee driven unto with blowes, it is an evill ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that followes his Captaine with ſighing, an evill ſervant that obeyes his maſter with grudging; God muſt have all done in love, and hee rewards a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:25053:120"/>
cheerefull ſervant.</p>
               <p>Now if any of you finde in your ſelves at any time an indiſpoſition, and backwardneſſe to holy duties, call then to minde with what livelineſſe you have followed your luſts, and be aſhamed and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that you cannot with as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes ſerve the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Reſ.</hi> There is hypocriſie in the beſt, all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are infected with this contamination, ſome more, ſome leſſe; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goeth about to cleere himſelfe in this, hee is the worſt hypocrite of all: and this wee muſt know, that though all are infected with it, yet here is the difference, all have hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, hypocriſie hath ſome <hi>aliud habere peccatum, aliud ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri à peccato,</hi> it is one thing for a man to profeſſe ſin
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:25053:128"/>
and another thing for ſin to poſſeſſe a man. Now though a regenerate man may finde this in him, yet may hee comfort himſelfe in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greife, and humbling unto him, feeling this in him, and having his heart away in any outward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That his care and deſire in obeying God, hath ever been to doe it heartily, and ſo could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hypocrite ſay.</p>
               <p>This muſt all know, for by the knowledge of this that it is not</p>

               <p>Firſt, For hypocriticall obedience: eye-ſervice may bee pleaſing unto men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the heart, but to God it can not. The proud Phariſee may make a faire ſhow, but God can pull of the maske, and diſcover him. All out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes an hypocrite may doe, onely he failes in the heart, and becauſe of that hee is loſt every where; it is man that judgeth the heart by the workes, but the LORD judgeth the workes by the heart. O therefore take heede of hypocriſie, leaſt you have your portion with them in Hell. Men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſolace your ſelves in your devotions; heare,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:25053:129"/>
read, pray, receive, but looke you have the heart along with you, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart all is loſt. Know this that the oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of man ſhall meete with the deteſtation of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Now if hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie <note place="margin">Conſtrained ſincerity no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> cannot content God, what can conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſincerity doe?

               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>There are many that have good hearts in whom there is great inconſtancy, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten omitting of good duties, which they ſhould performe, they have not alwayes that alacrity in Prayer and holy exerciſe, as ſometimes they have.</hi>

wee muſt not give our Members, Weapons of unrighteouſneſſe to ſinne: what then? wee muſt give our ſelves to God, and our Members of righteouſneſſe to ſerve God.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the fourth thing every receaver muſt examine, namely Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Now come wee to the fift and that is, Love.

               <p>Thirdly, examine wee <note place="margin">Loves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</note> muſt, becauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, for if this bee in us, then</p>
               <p>Firſt, our Faith produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth thoſe good duties which we owe unto God, for Faith is as one hand receiving, Love as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giving, <hi>for Faith wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by Love</hi>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:25053:136"/>
is as certaine, that the life of a man is juſtified by love.</p>
               <p>Secondly, having this love wee may know in what eſtate wee are in. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Duas</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, The love of <note place="margin">Love ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders love.</note> the godly will bee ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This love is <note place="margin">Love as ſtrong as death.</note> as ſtrong as death; for as death doth kill the body, ſo our love to God doth mortify our love to the World and diſpels rancor, wrath, malice, and as the riſing of the Sunne doth chaſe away the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night: ſo the love of God drives away the inordinate love of Worldly vanities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:25053:137"/>
Now it is not ſufficient to know that God muſt be loved, but wee muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo know how God is to be loved.</p>

               <p>Firſt wee muſt love him <note place="margin">God muſt be loved with all the heart.</note> with all our heart.

               <p>Thirdly, God muſt be loved with all our mind, ſo that our cogitations muſt be fixed upon him, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him; his word ſhould direct our Reaſon, our Reaſon rule our Wills, that ſo wee may ſay with the Apoſtle, wee live not, but God doth live within us,.

Let Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Beares, and Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards teare one another; let Scythians &amp; Cannibals eat one another, who know not God, nor good huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

all this to us.</p>
            <p>Now good reaſon have <note place="margin">Kind of love.</note> we to examine our love to man, for there are divers kinds of love.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Atheiſts love, <note place="margin">Atheists love.</note> and this comes from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or from pleaſure, which love men as the dog doth the bone; but this love proceedeth not <hi>ex cordepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> a pure heart, therefore it is a love condemned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <note place="margin">Gamesters love.</note> Drunkards love: for to gloſſe, play, eate, drinke, game, be no good workes, therefore this is not to love.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Carnall love.</note> love, and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for love in man may be a vice aſwell as a grace; it is a vice, when it

is ſet upon a wrong obiect, or is diſordered, and that three wayes.</p>
            <p>1. When we love things unlawfull, as ſinne.</p>
            <p>2. When we love things lawfull, but too much, as the world.</p>
            <p>3. When love is turned into luſt, and ſo it is the mother of fornication, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, inceſt, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a <note place="margin">Chriſtian love.</note> Chriſtian love, wee muſt love one another in the Lord, and for the Lord: this love is the badge of Chriſts Diſciples: <hi>by this ſhall all men know that you are my Diſciples indeed, if yee love one another as I have loved you</hi>

            <p>There is another love condemned, the love of <note place="margin">Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> Heretiques and Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call love, <hi>in cathedra unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Deus poſuit doctrinam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis,</hi> in the chaire of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath put the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of verity: they agree as the falſe Prophets did, not in the Lord, but againſt

the Lord. Papiſts boaſt much of their Councell of Trident, and how they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all meetings. Alas a few Biſhops of Italy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together, but thirty eight Biſhops in all, not like the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> where were three hundred and eighteene, or of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> where were ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Biſhops: nor like the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where were foure Patriarks twenty nine Cardinalls, two hundred threeſcore and ten Biſhops, forty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Arch-biſhops, five hundred threeſcore and foure Abbots and Doctors at the depoſing of <hi>Benedict</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>But our love let it bee as it ſhould bee, Chriſtian
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:25053:148"/>
love: let us love as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <note place="margin">Our love muſt bee Christian.</note> and then the God of love and peace ſhall bee with us: and if enemies will not bee pacified, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>commend the cauſe to God till wee meete in heaven, where all injury ſhall bee forgotten: and in the meane while <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did the Saints of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, I beſeech you I ſay) <hi>by the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that yee all ſpeake one thing, and that there be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion among you, but that yee bee knit together in one minde, and in one judgment</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note>: and <hi>whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are juſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are pure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things pertaine to love</hi>

and peace ſhall bee with you <note n="f" place="margin">1 Theſ. 3. 12.</note>, and the Lord increaſe your love, and make it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more and more one toward another. Chriſts Commandement is all love, his Spouſe is all lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and <hi>Iohn</hi> will preach nothing but love, and wee muſt follow after love, and above all have fervent love among our ſelves, for that ſhall cover a multitude of ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore it is not all love that is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it ſtands us in hand to examine our love, for none receive worthily but ſuch whoſe love is.</p>

that hides the blemiſhes of our ſinnefull nature, and the ſame Apoſtle cals upon us to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>to adde to our Faith, vertue; and to vertue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; to knowledge, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; to temperance, patience; and to patience, brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe charity</hi>

               <p>Wee have finiſhed the firſt concluſion, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily

muſt examine nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly. Come we to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

               <p>Doe this, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 24.</note>. So that it is not left indifferent for a man to come, or not to come, but commanded; I, if that wee looke but into the Booke of God, wee ſhall finde that ſuch as were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Wedding, and would not come, made light of it, were deſtroyed as well as hee that came without his Wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 22. 4. to 13.</note>.

               <p>Firſt, Who it is that calls, cries! It is the

               <p>Secondly, Conſider that beſides calling, bidding, ſending, he offers himſelfe, and what a fearefull thing is this to contemne this bleſſed Sacrament?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> to come up to the Lord, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered preſumptuouſly, <hi>we will not come</hi>

Doth he not invite us, I, the Table is covered, the ſupper is ready, yet how doe wee ſlight it? Many will come, but it is to looke on, not receave, what is this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, but to have the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of CHRIST in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? our Saviour did not ſay, let a man examine
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:25053:155"/>
himſelfe, and ſtay at home, or examine himſelfe, and looke on, <hi>but let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that</hi> Bread, <hi>and drinke of that</hi> Cup. With what face then, with what countenance or conſcience, can theſe come to the houſe, and Table of God? But it may be objected.</p>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:25053:155"/>
theſe had taſted of any ſweetneſſe at the Table of God, they would never have objected ſo abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or argued, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten received, therefore neede to receave no more, but rather I have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved therefore will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave againe. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none ſo abſurd as to ſay I have been often at the Church therefore I will bee ſeene there no more, I will heare no more becauſe I have heard a little; but as he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what it is to heare, will heare often, ſo hee that knowes what it is to receave the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with receaving, but will receave often.</p>

                  <hi>Reſ.</hi> True it is, that many come, and come often, and are no better, but the worſe for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; this is a ſigne that they are not good, yet God forbid that wee ſhould ſo hardly conclude of all that ſay they can feele no ſuch comfort at the Receiving of the bleſſed Sacrament, for howſoever ſome doe not for the preſent, and in the Act finde it, yet they may finde comfort, and have comfort. And here it will ſtand us all

in hand to conſider of five particulars, and to have them in minde.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That to forbeare comming will make us worſe than we are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is one thing to have grace, and another thing to feele grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That every man muſt with conſcience ſubmit himſelfe to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That no man was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made better by not comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it is a dangerous thing to ſtint God, to limit God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it concernes all to conſider of this.</p>
               <p>That if they ſhould not come to the Table of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:25053:157"/>
Lord, it is to bee doubted, <note place="margin">Not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament makes men worſe.</note> that albeit they ſhould not feele themſelves any whit the better, by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to it, they ſhould feele themſelves many degrees the worſe, and albeit that they feele not themſelves after their receiving as good as they deſired, yet if they come not at all, they ſhall be ſure to finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worſe than they were.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider wee <note place="margin">One thing to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:25053:157"/>
hee lives by faith, not by feeling.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider wee <note place="margin">Wee must ſubmit with conſcience to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> muſt, that every man muſt ſubmit himſelfe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the ordinance of God, and if thus they doe, they may aſſure themſelves that in the Lords good time they ſhall find comfort: for as they that are ſicke, will goe to the phyſitian, take his directions, ſtay his time, and in all things bee ruled by him, ſo muſt every poore ſinner that expects comfort for his ſoule, hee muſt ſtay the Lords time, who knowes when it will doe us the moſt good, and ſtand us in moſt ſtead?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, conſider wee <note place="margin">Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes not men better.</note> muſt of this, that no man was ever made better by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:25053:158"/>
withdrawing of himſelfe: Beloved, if this could bee proved, then ſomething might be ſaid, but I dare ſay that it was never knowne that any man was either richer in grace, ſtronger in faith, by keeping of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider wee <note place="margin">God muſt not be ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> muſt that it is a dangerous thing to ſtint God, to limit him, take heed we muſt of ſetting God a time, as now Lord, or to morrow Lord, let me feele comfort, like the unruly patient that will not be cured, unleſſe he bee cured out of hand.

               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:25053:158"/>Ob. 3. <hi>Some will obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that they would often come to Gods Table, but that they have ſo many infirmities, and manifold imperfections, and theſe they ſay do diſcourage them; their meaſure of faith, and grace they ſay is ſo little, that they are afraid to come, leaſt they ſhould come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</hi>

Chriſtians muſt uſe all the meanes that may bee to nouriſh the weake ones, thoſe that are weake in grace: as wee muſt warne them that are unruly, ſo wee are commanded to comfort the feeble; our imperfections though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, muſt not keepe us back, ſeeing that the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts us worthy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to come unto him.</p>
               <p>And here Receivers may conclude of foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt this, that the feeling <note place="margin">Feeling a want of grace with griefe is grace.</note> of the want of grace, with a grief for that want, is grace, for ſuch as are altogether graceleſſe, and ſenſeleſſe doe not find at any time any defect of grace in them ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:25053:159"/>
Secondly this, that no <note place="margin">Wee muſt not pleaſe our ſelues in our wants.</note> man muſt pleaſe himſelfe in his owne wants, nor nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the weakeneſſe that is in himſelfe; for albeit God condemneth no man for his wants, nor with-holds his grace from him for his imperfections, yet muſt not man make much of them, nor delight in them, nor thinke himſelfe the better for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly this, that it is a <note place="margin">Temptation of Satan dangerous, concerning want of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

will not bee labour loſt, if that we would but think of the perſons for whom the Supper was inſtituted, we ſhall finde that it was for the weak not for the ſtrong; for the poore, not for the rich: ſhall any man now reaſon ſo abſurdly, that becauſe he is hungry, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not eat, becauſe thirſty, therefore hee will not drinke, becauſe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therefore careth not for the Phyſitian? would not every one condemne theſe for unwiſe men? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it is no better than a divelliſh temptation, that becauſe wee are weake in grace, therefore wee will not receive the ſtrength of grace.</p>
